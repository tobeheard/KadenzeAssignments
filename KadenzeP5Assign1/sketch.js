// For this assignment:
// Select a crop of Paul Klee's "Dream City" and draw it using p5js as a 1024 x 768 pixel program.
// First select an interesting/ambitious crop, then load it into a program such as Photoshop
// to read the color and coordinate data. Your crop does not have to be 1024x768.
// You should create the crop, then resize to 1024x768 and use that as your reference.
// Use integer values for coordinates and only use the following functions for drawing:
// line(), triangle(), quad(), rect(), ellipse(), and arc().
// You must also use the stroke(), fill(), and background() functions in your sketch as well.
// Your assignment will be graded on specified code criteria, as well as how accurately your
// composition and colors match your selected crop.

function setup() {
  // put setup code here
}

  createCanvas(1024,768);
  background(0);
  ellipse(50,50,100,100);
  rect(35,0,35,65);
